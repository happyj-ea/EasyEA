Here are the maturity model supported by the EasyEA framework

How to Use This Model
1. Identify Your Current Stage: Look at how your organization handles technology and match it to one of the stages.
2. Set a Clear Goal: Use the “How to get to Stage” steps to determine what actions are needed to move to the next stage.
3. Take Action: Focus on practical steps, like creating processes, collecting data, or introducing tools, to make measurable progress.

Enterprise Architecture Maturity Assesment

--------------------------------------------------------
Stage 1: Unorganized and Reactive
--------------------------------------------------------
What it looks like now?
There’s no clear plan for how technology decisions are made.
Different teams do things their own way, leading to duplication and inefficiency.
Technology is chosen reactively to fix immediate problems, without considering long-term needs.

How to get to Stage 2?
Create a shared list of all the systems and tools being used across the organization.
Start developing simple, repeatable steps for making decisions about new technology.
Identify someone responsible for overseeing technology choices to ensure consistency.

--------------------------------------------------------
Stage 2: Basic Processes in Place
--------------------------------------------------------

What it looks like now?
Some basic processes exist, but not everyone follows them.
Teams are starting to collaborate, but there’s no consistent way to check if projects align with organizational goals.
Performance tracking is minimal or inconsistent.

How to get to Stage 3?
Standardize processes so they’re the same across all teams, and document them for easy reference.
Set up a simple review process to check if technology projects support the organization’s priorities.
Train teams on how to use the standardized processes and encourage collaboration.

--------------------------------------------------------
Stage 3: Standardized and Defined
--------------------------------------------------------

What it looks like now?
Processes are standardized and documented, and everyone follows them consistently.
Teams collaborate effectively, and technology projects are aligned with the organization’s goals.
Some data is being tracked, but it’s not yet used to make improvements.

How to get to Stage 4?
Start collecting and analyzing data to evaluate how well processes are working (e.g., are projects staying on budget and meeting goals?).
Introduce tools to help track performance in real-time, like dashboards.
Use the data to identify risks, inefficiencies, or areas for improvement and take proactive steps to address them.

--------------------------------------------------------
Stage 4: Data-Driven and Managed
--------------------------------------------------------

What it looks like now?
Technology decisions are consistent, and data is used to guide them.
Risks, like outdated tools or high costs, are spotted early and addressed proactively.
Teams regularly check if technology supports organizational priorities and make adjustments when needed.

How to get to Stage 5?
Introduce advanced tools, like predictive analytics or automation, to improve how technology is managed.
Create a feedback loop to continually refine processes based on lessons learned and stakeholder input.
Explore innovative technologies that can improve efficiency or add value to the organization.

--------------------------------------------------------
Stage 5: Optimized and Proactive
--------------------------------------------------------

What it looks like now?
Processes are fully optimized, and the organization constantly improves them.
Teams adopt new technologies quickly and smoothly, staying ahead of changes in the environment.
Collaboration and innovation are built into the culture, and feedback is regularly used to improve operations.
